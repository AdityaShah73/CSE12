    <p>Ekalavya (Sanskrit: एकलव्य, romanized: ekalavya, also spelt as Eklavya) is a character from the Hindu epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata" target="_blank">Mahābhārata </a>. He is described as a young prince of the Nishadas, a confederation of forest and hill tribes in ancient India.</p> <hr>


    <p>
        The son of Hiranyadhanus, a king of the Nishada tribe, Ekalavya seeks to learn archery from Dronacharya, the royal teacher of the Kuru princes, including the epic's main protagonist Arjuna. However, Dronacharya refuses to accept him as a disciple due to his Nishada background as well as the potential to surpass the Kuru princes. Ekalavya trains himself in the forest using a clay statue of the teacher as his guide. His exceptional skill attracts the attention of Arjuna, who, feeling threatened, complains to Dronacharya. In response, Dronacharya demands Ekalavya’s right-hand thumb as gurudakshina (teacher’s fee), which Ekalavya willingly gives, diminishing his abilities.

   <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya" target="_blank">Eklavya's</a> story is first narrated in the Adi Parva, the first book of the Mahabharata (c. 400 BCE - 400 CE). He is introduced as a young man and the son of Hiranyadhanus, a king of the Nishada (foresters). He approaches Dronacharya—the royal preceptor of the Kurus princes (Pandavas and Kauravas)—to learn archery, but Dronacharya refuses to accept him as a disciple due to his low status as a Nishada as well as his potential to exceed the Kuru princes in archery.[1] Determined to learn archery, Ekalavya goes to the nearby forest, creates a clay replica of Dronacharya, and dedicates himself to rigorous self-practice. His devotion makes him a highly skilled archer. During a hunting expedition, the Pandavas' hunting dog encounters Ekalavya and starts barking. Ekalavya shoots seven arrows into the dog’s mouth, keeping it open without harming it. The dog returns to Arjuna, who is astonished by the display of skill. Upon discovering that Ekalavya considers himself a disciple of Dronacharya, Arjuna feels disappointed and threatened, as Dronacharya has previously declared him to be his best student. Arjuna complains to Dronacharya, who approaches Ekalavya. Dronacharya, upon meeting Ekalavya, acknowledges his dedication but demands a gurudakshina (teacher’s fee)—his right thumb. Ekalavya, out of respect, complies and severs his thumb, which affects his archery skills and ensures Arjuna's superiority.[2]
